    {
      "question": "What is the difference between vertical and inclined letters?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Vertical letters are slanted left, inclined letters are slanted right",
        "b": "Inclined letters have a 75° slope, vertical letters don’t",
        "c": "Vertical letters are thicker than inclined letters",
        "d": "Vertical letters are used for titles, inclined letters for dimensions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Inclined (italic) lettering typically leans at an angle of about 75° to the horizontal for stylistic consistency, while vertical lettering stands upright. This distinction helps maintain uniformity in drawing presentation."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is maintaining uniform shape, slope, size, shade, and spacing important in lettering?",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Adjusting the background visually ensures uniform spacing between letters by compensating for the natural optical differences in letter shapes, leading to cleaner and more readable text."
